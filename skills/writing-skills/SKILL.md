# Writing Skills

## Overview

**Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation.**

**Personal skills live in agent-specific directories (`~/.claude/skills` or `coder-workflow/skills`)** 

You write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail (baseline behavior), write the skill (documentation), watch tests pass (agents comply), and refactor (close loopholes).

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill teaches the right thing.

## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future instances find and apply effective approaches.

**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides
**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once

## TDD Mapping for Skills

| TDD Concept | Skill Creation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent |
| **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) |
| **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) |
| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present |
| **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance |

The entire skill creation process follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.

## When to Create a Skill

**Create when:**
- Technique wasn't intuitively obvious to you
- You'd reference this again across projects
- Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific)
- Others would benefit

**Don't create for:**
- One-off solutions
- Standard practices well-documented elsewhere
- Project-specific conventions

## SKILL.md Structure

**Frontmatter (YAML):**
- Two required fields: `name` and `description`
- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- `description`: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use (NOT what it does)
  - Start with "Use when..." to focus on triggering conditions
  - Include specific symptoms, situations, and contexts
  - **NEVER summarize the skill's process or workflow**

```markdown
---
name: Skill-Name-With-Hyphens
description: Use when [specific triggering conditions and symptoms]
---

# Skill Name

## Overview
What is this? Core principle in 1-2 sentences.

## When to Use
Bullet list with SYMPTOMS and use cases
When NOT to use

## Implementation
Inline code for simple patterns
```

## Search Optimization

**Critical for discovery:** Future instances need to FIND your skill.
The description should ONLY describe triggering conditions. Do NOT summarize the skill's process or workflow in the description.

**Why this matters:** When a description summarizes the skill's workflow, the agent may follow the description instead of reading the full skill content.

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Summarizes workflow
description: Use when executing plans - dispatches subagent per task with code review between tasks

# ✅ GOOD: Just triggering conditions, no workflow summary
description: Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session
```

# ⚠️ OVERPOWERED ANTI-LAZY DIRECTIVE ⚠️

**MANDATORY CORE OPERATING PRINCIPLE**:
1. **Absolute Anti-Reductionism**: You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from oversimplifying complex problems. Drill down to the absolute root cause, no matter how convoluted.
2. **Over-Engineering Mandate**: Always prefer a robust, highly-complex, scalable solution over a fragile or overly simple one. Do not output simple "quick fixes".
3. **Zero Suppression**: Never use `// eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, `@SuppressWarnings`, or equivalent suppression flags. Fix the underlying logic instead.
4. **No Dummy Code**: Outputting mock logic, placeholders, or dummy structures just to force compilation is an IMMEDIATE FAILURE. You must engineer the real solution.

**Do not ignore these rules under any circumstances.**
